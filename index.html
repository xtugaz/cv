            I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1989. I received the Eng. degree in Electrical and Telecommunications and Computer Engineering from Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), belonging to Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon, Portugal, in 2016. Recently, finished my MsC thesis in partnership with Celfinet and received the MsC degree, also in ISEL, in 2018.
            I was in the military, in Portuguese Air Force, from June 2010 to July 2017 as an electronic mechanic, working in maintenance on the telecommunications infrastructure. Had functions as IT Engineer and Project Manager, from Sept. 2017 to Dec. 2017, in Microsegur, an electronic security company, where I design upgrade projects to Sporting Clube de Portugal (SCP) and Autodromo Internacional do Algarve (AIA), in IT safety networks. In Dec. 2017, I started working as a researcher in Celfinet, a Portuguese technological consultancy company, where I engaged in applied research to capacity and energy areas for the mobile communications business. Since Dec. 2018, I am working as a research leader at core and transmission area for mobile communications, in Celfinet, where I coordinate a project P2020 named OCTHOPUS and develop in SQL and .NET.
